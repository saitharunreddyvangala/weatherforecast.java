Project Title: Simple Weather Forecasting App

Overview:
The Simple Weather Forecasting App is a console-based application developed in Java that allows users to get weather information for a specific location. The application fetches weather data from a public API, parses the information, and displays it to the user.

Key Features:

    Get Weather Information:
        Users can input the name of a city or location.
        The application queries a weather API to retrieve current weather data for the specified location.

    Display Weather Details:
        The app presents key weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

    Error Handling:
        The app includes error handling to deal with invalid user input or issues with the weather API.

Implementation:

    The project is implemented using Java and leverages the java.net package for making HTTP requests to a weather API.
    The JSON response from the API is parsed using a JSON library (such as Jackson or Gson).
    The core functionality is encapsulated in classes like WeatherFetcher, WeatherData, and WeatherApp.

How to Use:

    Run the WeatherApp class to initiate the application.
    Enter the name of the city or location for which you want to get the weather forecast.
    The app will display relevant weather details.

Why This Project:
This project provides hands-on experience with making HTTP requests, handling JSON data, and creating a simple console-based application. It's a practical way to learn about data fetching, parsing, and user interaction in Java.

Possible Extensions:

    Enhance the application by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
    Implement caching to store previously fetched weather data and minimize API calls.
    Include additional features such as a multi-day forecast or weather alerts.
